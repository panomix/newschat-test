    <h1>How AI is Transforming Journalism</h1>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence is increasingly being used to generate, summarize,
      and even personalize news content for readers around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      News organizations are adopting large language models to help with
      everything from writing headlines to suggesting related articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has led to both excitement and concern over the role of humans in
      future newsrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some worry that AI will replace traditional reporting jobs, while others
      believe it will simply augment journalists' abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, the news landscape is changing rapidly as publishers look for
      ways to stay competitive in the digital age.
